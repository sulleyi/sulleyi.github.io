# Ian Sulley
A blog to chronicle experiences in music, art & technology.

## Welcome!

I was inspired to start this site by my good friend [Miles Conn](http://milesconn.io).
Go check out his site for more musings on technology. Thanks for the help in getting
this site set up.

Anyways, I hope you enjoy this site. Go learn something **new**!

### Now Entering a Construction Zone. *Hardhats Required*

I'm just getting started so there isn't much to see here yet. Come back later for some cool content!

If you care to see what I'm currently working on, check out my [Github](https://github.com/sulleyi).
