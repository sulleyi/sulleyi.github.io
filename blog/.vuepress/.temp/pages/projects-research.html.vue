<p>I am currently gather information on tinyML and computational security specifically regarding ML and AI algorithms. The ethical use of (ML &amp; AI) software relies on the continuous development of secure systems that value robustness and user privacy. Federated Learning shows great promise as a starting point in solving these issues.</p>
