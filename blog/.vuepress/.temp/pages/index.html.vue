<p>I was inspired to start this site by my good friend <a href="http://milesconn.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Miles Conn</a>.
Go check out his site for more musings on technology. Thanks for the help in getting
this site set up.</p>
<p>I'm just getting started so there isn't much to see here yet. Come back later for some cool content!</p>
<p>If you care to see what I'm currently working on, check out my <a href="https://github.com/sulleyi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Github</a>.</p>
<p>Anyways, I hope you enjoy this site.</p>
